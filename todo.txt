//* Breakdown of the bug fixes: 

[] Restriction if the email and password are incorrect.
    * The user cannot access the other page once the credentials are not correct or in empty fields.

[] Get the state authenticated to verify the user access to the protected routes.

//* Notes: 

Hard

* The user is already authenticated once the user enters the credentials. Hence, it also accepts the incorrect credentials to be authenticated 
 which change the state authenticated into true.

* The token can be saved in local storage, yet there is no function or logic to get the token to the protected routes.
